# Hero-Battles
Hero's Battles is a game I created that does not really have any gaming component but dives into the wonderful world of designing

**Side Note:** If you try it out, make sure to change the directory of the "Player Movements" folder.

This is one of my favourite projects because of all the new discoveries I made designing it. Firstly, I learnt about sprites and animations in pygame as well as pixel contact. Secondly, I was able to connect the dots between math and creating games in terms of character movement. It showed me the relavance and importance of classes such as Calculus that help bring pixels to life. For example, in this game, bounds were created for the character to not move out of it's poistion and making the character jump which is similar to an inverse parabolic curve.
